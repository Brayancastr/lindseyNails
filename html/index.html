    <ul>
      <li>Basic Manicure: A basic or standard manicure is the traditional manicure that you're probably familiar with. Here your nails are trimmed, shaped and buffed. Cuticle oil is applied and cuticles are managed too. You'll usually get to enjoy a wonderfully relaxing hand massage. At the end, standard nail polish is applied.</li>
      <br><li>French Manicure: a manicure in which a band of usually white polish across the tip of the nail contrasts with the often clear or pale polish below</li>
      <br><li>Press-On Manicure : Press on nails, also known as glue on nails, were super popular in the late 90's/early 00's. They are artificial, acrylic nails that are already made up; the client simply has to glue them onto the top of their natural nail.</li>
